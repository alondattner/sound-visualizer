# SoundVisualizer
SoundVisualizer is a dynamic 3D audio-reactive visualizer that responds to music in real time, creating vibrant shapes and colors based on sound. It features a rotating, evolving visual display that reacts to the music's amplitude, creating a mesmerizing experience. This project was created for a p5.js course as part of my master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
**Warning:** May cause discomfort for those with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.

## Usage
